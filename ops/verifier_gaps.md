# Verifier Gaps — the missing-verifier backlog (Carnot's core product backlog)

**WHY (operator directive 2026-06-09):** "we should make note of any 'missing' Carnot ARC
verifiers that might help improve our results — this will help us improve the core function of
Carnot as a verifier, which has become the point of this project."

Carnot's value-add is the VERIFIER. Every case where the verifier *cannot select the correct
answer* — because no existing invariant/energy captures the discriminating signal — is a
**missing-verifier spec**. Filling these specs is the product. This file is the complement of
`ops/verifier_registry.yaml`: the registry lists the verifiers we HAVE; this ledger lists the
verifiers we NEED, with the evidence that motivates each, so the planner can queue verifier-build
tasks against it.

**How a gap gets here.** Any ARC/verifier experiment that finds a case where the correct answer is
present-but-unselectable (e.g. an oracle ceiling the verifier can't reach, a distractor class with
≈chance discrimination, a task family where every applicable family abstains) appends a gap entry:
the failure mode, the discriminator that was MISSING, and what a new verifier would need to compute.
Never-prune; `status: filled` (with the registry verifier_id that closed it) rather than deletion.

**Schema (one entry per gap):**
```
### GAP-<n>: <short capability name>
- status: open | building | filled (<verifier_id>)
- evidence: <experiment artifact + the measured failure mode/number>
- failure mode: <what the verifier mis-ranks and why the existing families are blind>
- missing discriminator: <the signal a new verifier must compute>
- candidate design: <how it could be built — invariant family / energy / learned>
- priority: high | medium | low (by how much pass@K / accuracy headroom it would unlock)
```

## Empirical confirmation (TRM rerank, 2026-06-09)

`results/arc3_trm_verifier_rerank.json` (n=31-task subset of TRM's arc_v1 candidate pool) tested
whether the `union_max` ensemble reranks TRM's candidates better than its own frequency vote. **It
did NOT** (best = TRM_VOTE pass@2 0.484; verifier captured 0.0 of the ~13pp present-but-mis-voted
headroom; HYBRID hurt to 0.452). This is an honest WASH (reported as-is per FALSE_NEGATIVE_RISK) — and
it is the *value*: of the 5 uncaptured tasks (correct answer in TRM's pool, verifier still missed it),
the census split **GAP-1: 2, GAP-2: 1, GAP-3: 2**, confirming all three gaps below on REAL mis-votes
(not just the synthetic distractors the v2 ensemble was measured on). Building any of these three
verifiers is the direct path to capturing that headroom. (Caveat: 31-task subset; counts are small but
directional — re-confirm at scale.)

## Open gaps

### GAP-1: transpose / orientation discrimination
- status: open
- evidence: design survey of `arc_grid_verifier_invariants_v2_combined` (2026-06-09) +
  `results/arc_grid_verifier_invariants_v2.json` — the square-transpose distractor subset (239 tasks)
  sits at `union_max ≈ 0.53` (≈ chance); `transposed` gold-strictly-better-rate 0.293 (well below the
  0.70 catch bar).
- failure mode: the always-on content families (`object_count`, `palette_histogram_shape`) are
  PROVABLY transpose-invariant — a grid and its transpose have identical object statistics and color
  histograms — so they cannot distinguish the correct output from its transpose. v1 (dims/palette) is
  also blind when the transpose preserves dimensions (square grids).
- missing discriminator: a verifier sensitive to SPATIAL ARRANGEMENT / orientation that is NOT
  transpose-invariant — e.g. per-position / directional adjacency consistency with the train outputs,
  or a learned positional-pattern energy.
- candidate design: a `positional_adjacency` invariant family (row/column-ordered edge statistics, or
  an oriented content-overlap that does not symmetrize over the dihedral group); gate it on
  fixed-output-dim tasks.
- priority: high (transpose-class mis-votes are a large, currently-uncapturable slice).

### GAP-2: content verification for VARIABLE-output-dim tasks
- status: open
- evidence: design survey (2026-06-09) — the positional/transformation families
  (`content_overlap`, `color_mapping`, `delta_pattern`) ABSTAIN on variable-output-dim / non-positional
  tasks (~half of ARC), so the ensemble falls back to v1 + `object_count` + `palette_histogram` (all
  content-weak). The residual null space concentrates here.
- failure mode: when the output dimensions are not a fixed function of the input, the positional
  families have no canvas to align to and return "not applicable", leaving only structure + count/
  histogram signals — which a content-wrong-but-count-preserving candidate passes.
- missing discriminator: an object-RELATIONAL / rule-application consistency verifier that does not
  require fixed positions — e.g. "does the same object-level transformation inferred from train map
  the test input to this candidate?" (object correspondence + per-object op consistency).
- candidate design: an `object_relational_rule` family (segment objects, infer per-object train ops,
  score candidate disagreement) and/or a learned program-consistency energy (the ARC-domain energy
  instance, per `project_verifier_domain_bound`).
- priority: high (~half of ARC is variable-output-dim; this is the biggest coverage hole).
- ALT candidate design (model-native, 2026-06-09): per arXiv:2604.17614 ("Characterizing Model-Native
  Skills"), recover a compact ORTHOGONAL basis from the GENERATOR's own activations and score candidate
  consistency along it, instead of hand-imposed grid invariants. Feasible here because TRM is open/local
  (we have its activations). Directly attacks GAP-2/GAP-3 (the content/rule axes hand-features miss) AND
  the verifier-orthogonality program (a model-native orthogonal basis = principled distinct null spaces,
  vs the SHARED transpose-invariance of object_count+palette_histogram = GAP-1). White-box-complement to
  the black-box energy verifier ([[reference_cognometry]], [[reference_goodfire_silico]]). TRM-specific
  (needs generator activations) — not a general verifier. The GAP-3 follow-up if hand-invariants wash.

### GAP-3: content errors that preserve ALL cheap invariants
- status: open (partially mitigated by the v2 transformation families)
- evidence: `results/arc_grid_verifier_discriminator.json` — v1 is `PRUNER_NOT_SELECTOR`
  (perturbed_gold gold-strictly-better-rate 0.006, tie_rate 0.99); the v2 ensemble lifts perturbed_gold
  to 0.78 and color_swap to 0.75 but a residual remains for candidates that are structurally valid AND
  object-count/histogram-preserving AND positionally non-alignable.
- failure mode: a candidate that is the right size, palette, background, object-count, and color-
  histogram but applies the wrong RULE is in the joint null space of every cheap invariant.
- missing discriminator: a genuine rule-application / consistency-ENERGY verifier trained on ARC
  transitions (not a hand invariant) — the "new ARC energy instance" the domain-bound analysis calls
  for (`project_verifier_domain_bound`).
- priority: medium-high (this is the deep version of GAP-2; a learned energy may subsume both).
