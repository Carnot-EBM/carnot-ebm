# Carnot — Changelog

## 2026-04-04: Session handoff — autoresearch proven, all E2E debts cleared

### Summary
Full session: Gibbs JAX, PyO3 tests, Claude API bridge, LLM hypothesis generator, 5 benchmark energy functions, adversarial reviewer agent, E2E training+sampling tests, E2E serialization tests, JIT timing fix, 10-iteration autoresearch run with Sonnet. DoubleWell energy reduced 83% (0.95→0.16) via LLM-proposed improvements. Rosenbrock NaN identified as gradient clipping gap — next session priority.

### Commits
- `77e63d6` — Gibbs JAX, PyO3 tests, Claude API bridge, LLM autoresearch, benchmarks
- `41b3123` — Adversarial reviewer agent + close all review gaps
- `b8a0481` — E2E tests: training+sampling pipeline and serialization round-trip
- `7b5ab9f` — JIT grace period + 10-iteration Sonnet autoresearch run

## 2026-04-03: Gibbs JAX + PyO3 Tests + Claude API Bridge + LLM Autoresearch (user instruction: implement Gibbs JAX, PyO3 tests, real autoresearch with LLM)

### Added
- **Gibbs Python/JAX model** (`python/carnot/models/gibbs.py`): Full `GibbsConfig` + `GibbsModel` with SiLU/ReLU/Tanh activations, multi-layer dense energy network, AutoGradMixin for auto-differentiation. 20 tests in `test_models_gibbs.py`.
- **PyO3 integration tests** (`tests/python/test_pyo3_integration.py`): 24 tests covering all 3 Rust model tiers + both samplers via `carnot._rust`. Validates end-to-end Rust↔Python bridge.
- **Claude Code API bridge** (`tools/claude-api-bridge/`): FastAPI server + Dockerfile wrapping `claude -p` as OpenAI-compatible API. Supports streaming SSE, non-streaming JSON, `--mcp-config` for tool use, session management. Tested with Docker + OpenAI Python SDK.
- **LLM hypothesis generator** (`python/carnot/autoresearch/hypothesis_generator.py`): `GeneratorConfig`, `generate_hypotheses()`, `generate_hypotheses_batch()` using OpenAI SDK against any compatible endpoint.
- **Generator-based orchestrator** (`run_loop_with_generator()` in orchestrator.py): Lazy hypothesis generation with failure feedback loop. Backwards-compatible with existing `run_loop()`.
- **LLM autoresearch demo** (`scripts/run_autoresearch_llm.py`): End-to-end script connecting LLM → sandbox → evaluator. Verified working with Claude Haiku and Sonnet via API bridge.
- 27 new tests for hypothesis generator and generator-based loop.

### Added (continued)
- **Benchmark energy functions** (`python/carnot/benchmarks/`): All 5 analytical benchmarks (DoubleWell, Rosenbrock, Ackley, Rastrigin, GaussianMixture) as JAX EnergyFunction classes with AutoGradMixin. Known global minima for quantitative evaluation. 33 tests. Wired into autoresearch pipeline — baselines now computed from real mathematical landscapes.

### Fixed
- **PyO3 module name mismatch**: Renamed `#[pymodule] fn carnot_python` → `fn _rust` in `crates/carnot-python/src/lib.rs` to match `pyproject.toml`'s `module-name = "carnot._rust"`.
- **Ackley gradient NaN at origin**: Added epsilon in sqrt to prevent jax.grad NaN from d/dx sqrt(0).

### Updated
- `python/carnot/models/__init__.py`: exports `GibbsConfig, GibbsModel`
- `python/carnot/autoresearch/__init__.py`: exports `run_loop_with_generator`

### Test Results
- Python: 237 tests + 24 PyO3 integration tests, 100% code coverage
- Rust: 100 tests, all pass
- Real autoresearch run: 3 iterations with Sonnet, all 3 accepted, real Carnot sampler code executed in sandbox

## 2026-04-03: Spec Reconciliation (user instruction: reconcile specs with reality)

### Updated
- **All 5 OpenSpec Implementation Status tables** reconciled with actual code/test state
- **Traceability matrix** (`_bmad/traceability.md`): FR-08 Not Started → Partial, FR-11 Spec'd → Partial, FR-12 Spec'd → Implemented, test counts updated, NFR statuses updated
- **ops/status.md**: comprehensive update reflecting all implemented features and remaining gaps
- Added **spec-reconciler agent** (`.claude/agents/spec-reconciler.md`) and `/reconcile-specs` command to prevent future spec drift

### Key discrepancies found and fixed
- 24 requirements were implemented but specs still claimed "Not Started"
- FR-08 (PyO3 interoperability) had full bindings but traceability said "Not Started"
- FR-11 (autoresearch) had sandbox, evaluator, orchestrator, Docker sandbox but traceability said "Spec'd"
- FR-12 (verifiable reasoning) had 12 of 14 requirements implemented but traceability said "Spec'd"
