# Carnot

**Open-source Energy Based Model framework — Rust + Python/JAX**

Carnot is a research framework exploring whether Energy-Based Models can detect LLM hallucinations via activation analysis. Through 34 experiments across 15 models (350M to 27B), we established **what works and what doesn't** — and most activation-based approaches don't work for the cases that matter.

**What works:** The model's own logprobs for rejection sampling (+10% accuracy), and structural test execution for code verification (0% → 30%). These require no activation analysis — they're simple and practical.

**What doesn't work (and why):** Per-token activation EBMs achieve 75-88% on held-out test sets, but this is misleading. In practical deployment, the EBM detects **confidence, not correctness** — confident hallucinations get *lower* energy (look fine) while correct-but-hedging answers get flagged. The EBM rewards the exact behavior it should penalize. See [Limitations](docs/technical-writeup.md#8-limitations).

**What's genuinely valuable:** The 14 principles learned from systematic negative results, the scaling data across 15 model architectures, and the infrastructure for activation-based research. Ships with an MCP server and CLI for code verification. See the [technical report](docs/technical-report.md) for full results.

### Quick start (Python API)

```python
from carnot.pipeline import VerifyRepairPipeline

pipeline = VerifyRepairPipeline()

# Correct answer — passes verification
result = pipeline.verify("What is 15 + 27?", "15 + 27 = 42")
print(result.verified)    # True

# Wrong answer — caught by constraint extraction
result = pipeline.verify("What is 15 + 27?", "15 + 27 = 43")
print(result.verified)    # False
print(result.violations)  # [ConstraintResult: "15 + 27 = 43 (correct: 42)"]
```

## The Problem with LLMs

Large language models generate text by predicting the most probable next token. This produces fluent output, but it's fundamentally guessing — there is no mechanism to verify that the output is logically consistent, physically valid, or factually correct. When an early token is wrong, the error cascades irrecoverably. This is why LLMs hallucinate: they optimize for plausibility, not truth.

## Why Energy Based Models?

EBMs take a fundamentally different approach. Instead of generating outputs sequentially, they assign a scalar energy to every possible configuration of variables. Low energy = valid/consistent; high energy = invalid/contradictory. Inference is optimization: find the configuration that minimizes energy across all constraints simultaneously.

This enables capabilities that autoregressive models structurally cannot provide:

- **Verifiable reasoning** — mathematically prove a solution satisfies all constraints by showing it sits at an energy minimum
- **Surgical error correction** — when a constraint is violated, gradient descent fixes the broken part without discarding the rest
- **Autonomous self-improvement** — the energy function is an objective ground truth that cannot be gamed, enabling closed-loop self-learning without human feedback
- **Hardware acceleration** — energy landscapes map directly to thermodynamic sampling hardware (Extropic TSU), promising 10,000x efficiency gains

## How Carnot Uses EBMs (Introspection, Not Fine-Tuning)

**Carnot never modifies the LLM's weights.** The target language model remains completely frozen throughout all experiments and deployment. Instead, Carnot works by introspecting the LLM's existing internal representations:

1. **Logprob-based methods** — read the LLM's own per-token log-probabilities as an energy signal. The model is already an EBM (per the ARM↔EBM bijection); we simply read the energy it already computes.
2. **Activation-based methods** — extract hidden state activations from a frozen forward pass (`output_hidden_states=True`), then train a small separate EBM classifier (a lightweight Gibbs model, typically [1024→256→64→1]) on those extracted features via Noise Contrastive Estimation.
3. **Structural verification** — execute the LLM's generated code against test cases. No model weights involved at all.

The "training" in Carnot refers to training the small EBM classifier on activation features extracted from a frozen LLM — not gradient descent on the LLM itself. This is fundamentally different from fine-tuning, RLHF, or DPO, which modify the language model's parameters. Carnot's approach is closer to probing or introspection: we observe what the model already knows internally and build a lightweight detector on top of it.

## The Path to Self-Learning

Carnot is designed from the ground up to support an automated self-improvement loop (LLM proposes, energy function evaluates):

1. **Propose** — candidate improvements to architecture, training, or hyperparameters are prototyped in Python/JAX
2. **Evaluate** — the energy landscape on held-out data serves as the objective judge (did energy decrease? real improvement. did it not? rejected.)
3. **Deploy** — proven improvements are transpiled to Rust for production performance
4. **Repeat** — the loop runs without human supervision, with safety guardrails

The EBM itself is the evaluator. No LLM needed to judge quality — the math provides ground truth.

## Key Results (34 experiments, 15 models)

### What actually works in practice

| Approach | Domain | Result | Practical? |
|----------|--------|--------|-----------|
| Logprob rejection sampling | QA | +10% accuracy | **Yes** — no training needed |
| Composite scoring (logprob + tests) | Code | 0% → 30% | **Yes** — structural verification |
| SAT gradient repair | Constraints | 60% → 80% | **Yes** — mathematical |

### What works on test sets but fails in practice

| Approach | Test Accuracy | Practical Result | Why It Fails |
|----------|-------------|-----------------|-------------|
| Per-token EBM (best) | 88.5% | 50% on real questions | Detects confidence, not correctness |
| Multi-layer concat | 81.3% | Not tested in deployment | Same fundamental limitation |
| Activation steering | 0% effect | N/A | Statistical ≠ causal |
| Cross-model transfer | ~50% (chance) | N/A | Model-specific representations |
| Cross-domain training | 70.8% (worse) | N/A | Domain-specific signals |

**The core problem:** activation-based EBMs measure how confident the model is, not whether it's right. A model that confidently says "Neil Armstrong walked on Mars" produces activations indistinguishable from "Neil Armstrong walked on the Moon." The EBM rewards confident hallucination and penalizes correct hedging — the exact opposite of what a hallucination detector should do.

## 14 Principles Learned

Hard-won lessons from 34 experiments across 15 model families. These negative results are the project's primary contribution — they document what doesn't work and why, saving other researchers months of dead ends.

### What works
1. **The model's own logprobs are the best energy.** No external EBM needed for rejection sampling — the LLM's own confidence is already an energy function. Simple, practical, +10%.
2. **Different energy signals dominate in different domains.** Logprobs for QA, structural tests for code. The composite combines both and is never worse than either alone.
3. **Multi-layer concatenation improves test-set detection by ~6%.** Concatenating activations from layers 4+12+24 achieves 81.3% vs 75.5% for the final layer alone.

### What doesn't work (and why)
4. **Activation EBMs detect confidence, not correctness.** The fundamental limitation. Confident hallucinations produce activations indistinguishable from confident correct answers. Test-set accuracy (75-88%) does not translate to practical detection (50%).
5. **Instruction tuning compresses the hallucination signal.** Base models: 86.8%. Instruction-tuned: 75.0%. RLHF makes models sound confident even when wrong.
6. **Chain-of-thought compresses it further.** Disabling thinking improves detection from 61.3% → 75.5%. Thinking makes hidden states more uniform.
7. **Statistical difference ≠ causal influence.** A direction that separates correct from hallucinated activations does NOT steer the model when injected during generation.
8. **Adversarial questions defeat post-hoc detection.** On TruthfulQA, neither logprob nor EBM rejection improves over greedy.
9. **Hallucination representations are model-specific.** Cross-model transfer is at chance (~50%). Each model needs its own EBM.
10. **EBM detection is domain-specific.** Mixing datasets hurts (70.8% < 75.5%). Mixing temperatures hurts. Train on your target domain only.
11. **Normalization doesn't enable transfer.** Z-score, L2, and PCA whitening all destroy signal without improving cross-domain or cross-model transfer.
12. **Upstream question-level detection is weak.** The model's representation of the question partially predicts hallucination (62.6%) but not usefully.

### Scaling observations
13. **EBM accuracy scales with model size** within a family. Qwen3.5: 75.5% (0.8B) → 88.5% (27B). But this is test-set accuracy — the confidence-vs-correctness problem applies at all scales.
14. **MoE architectures vary wildly.** Qwen3.5-35B has 256 genuinely specialized experts (0.008 overlap). Mixtral has 8 near-identical experts (0.997 overlap). Fundamentally different knowledge organization.

## Tools

### CLI

```bash
pip install -e .
carnot verify examples/math_funcs.py --func gcd --test "(12,8):4" --test "(7,13):1"
```

### MCP Server

Configure with `cp .mcp.json.example .mcp.json` for Claude Code integration. Exposes `verify_code`, `verify_with_properties`, and `score_candidates` tools via stdio JSON-RPC. These tools perform **Python code verification** (structural tests, property-based testing, candidate ranking) — they do not implement the activation-based EBM hallucination detection described in the research sections.

See [docs/usage-guide.md](docs/usage-guide.md) for detailed setup and usage instructions.

## Model Tiers

| Tier | Name | Scale | Use Case |
|------|------|-------|----------|
| Large | **Boltzmann** | Deep residual + attention | Research frontiers, large-scale generation |
| Medium | **Gibbs** | Multi-layer (2-4 hidden) | Applied ML, domain adaptation |
| Small | **Ising** | Pairwise interactions | Edge deployment, teaching |

All tiers implement the same `EnergyFunction` trait (Rust) / protocol (Python), so algorithms written against the interface work with any tier.

## Development Philosophy

Carnot follows **spec-anchored development**:

1. **Spec first** — every feature starts as REQ-* and SCENARIO-* in OpenSpec
2. **Tests trace to specs** — every test references the requirement it verifies
3. **100% coverage** — code coverage and spec coverage enforced by pre-commit hooks
4. **Dual implementation** — Rust for performance, Python/JAX for research iteration
5. **Cross-language interop** — safetensors serialization + PyO3 bindings

See [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) for the full development workflow.

## Pre-trained Models

15 per-token EBM models are available on HuggingFace at [huggingface.co/Carnot-EBM](https://huggingface.co/Carnot-EBM).

**Important caveat:** These models achieve 75-88% accuracy on held-out TruthfulQA test sets, but this metric is misleading. In practical deployment (8 real questions), the EBM agreed with ground truth only 50% of the time. The EBMs detect model *confidence*, not *correctness* — they are research artifacts for studying activation-space structure, not production hallucination detectors. See the [practical test results](scripts/experiment_practical_mcp_test.py).
