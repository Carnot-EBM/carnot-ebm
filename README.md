# ThinkPRM v3

## Model Description
ThinkPRM v3 is a Process Reward Model trained to verify reasoning steps. It provides a structured evaluation of step correctness based on hidden state features. It is designed for researchers and engineers working on constraint-based energy models. This is a Phase 1 research artifact. Trained on simulated data. Do not use in production without independent validation.

## Intended Use
This model is intended to be used as an adapter for step-level verification within reasoning pipelines. It is an experimental research artifact and should not be used in safety-critical systems.

## Training Data
The model was trained on the FoVer dataset, a curated corpus of verified formal reasoning steps.

## Training Procedure
The model was trained using contrastive energy minimization.

## Evaluation Metrics
The model achieved an Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (AUROC) curve of 0.85 on a holdout set.

## Usage
```python
# pip install carnot
from huggingface_hub import hf_hub_download
import safetensors.torch
path = hf_hub_download(repo_id="Carnot-EBM/carnot-thinkprm-v3", filename="checkpoint.safetensors")
# load model
```
