# Carnot

**Open-source Energy Based Model framework — Rust + Python/JAX**

Carnot is an Energy-Based Model framework for **verifying and repairing LLM outputs**. Through 85+ experiments across 4 milestones, we proved that structural constraint verification via Ising models catches hallucinations that activation-based approaches miss — and that a verify-repair loop can fix them automatically.

**The breakthrough:** LLM proposes → Ising verifies → repair loop fixes. Live LLM pipeline achieves 19/20 accuracy with 100% hallucination detection. HumanEval pass@1 improves from 90% to 96% with Ising-guided repair. Verify-repair loop improves tricky questions from 60% to 87%.

**What ships today:** `VerifyRepairPipeline` — verify any LLM output in 5 lines of Python. CLI (`carnot pipeline verify`), MCP server for Claude Code, 5 integration examples, full API docs. Constraint extraction across arithmetic, code, logic, and natural language domains.

**What we learned:** Activation-based EBMs detect confidence, not correctness (50% practical). The 14 principles from our systematic negative results save other researchers months of dead ends. Structural constraint verification is what actually works. See the [technical report](docs/technical-report.md) for full results.

## Install

```bash
# Python (3.11+)
pip install -e ".[dev]"

# Verify it works
carnot verify examples/math_funcs.py --func gcd --test "(12,8):4" --test "(7,13):1"
```

> GPU: `pip install carnot[cuda]` for CUDA 12. On AMD/ROCm, use `JAX_PLATFORMS=cpu`.
> Rust bindings (optional): `pip install carnot[rust]` with Rust toolchain installed.

### Quick start (Python API)

```python
from carnot.pipeline import VerifyRepairPipeline

pipeline = VerifyRepairPipeline()

# Correct answer — passes verification
result = pipeline.verify("What is 15 + 27?", "15 + 27 = 42")
print(result.verified)    # True

# Wrong answer — caught by constraint extraction
result = pipeline.verify("What is 15 + 27?", "15 + 27 = 43")
print(result.verified)    # False
print(result.violations)  # [ConstraintResult: "15 + 27 = 43 (correct: 42)"]
```

## The Problem with LLMs

Large language models generate text by predicting the most probable next token. This produces fluent output, but it's fundamentally guessing — there is no mechanism to verify that the output is logically consistent, physically valid, or factually correct. When an early token is wrong, the error cascades irrecoverably. This is why LLMs hallucinate: they optimize for plausibility, not truth.

## Why Energy Based Models?

EBMs take a fundamentally different approach. Instead of generating outputs sequentially, they assign a scalar energy to every possible configuration of variables. Low energy = valid/consistent; high energy = invalid/contradictory. Inference is optimization: find the configuration that minimizes energy across all constraints simultaneously.

This enables capabilities that autoregressive models structurally cannot provide:

- **Verifiable reasoning** — mathematically prove a solution satisfies all constraints by showing it sits at an energy minimum
- **Surgical error correction** — when a constraint is violated, gradient descent fixes the broken part without discarding the rest
- **Autonomous self-improvement** — the energy function is an objective ground truth that cannot be gamed, enabling closed-loop self-learning without human feedback
- **Hardware acceleration** — energy landscapes map directly to thermodynamic sampling hardware (Extropic TSU), promising 10,000x efficiency gains

## How Carnot Uses EBMs (Introspection, Not Fine-Tuning)

**Carnot never modifies the LLM's weights.** The target language model remains completely frozen throughout all experiments and deployment. Instead, Carnot works by introspecting the LLM's existing internal representations:

1. **Logprob-based methods** — read the LLM's own per-token log-probabilities as an energy signal. The model is already an EBM (per the ARM↔EBM bijection); we simply read the energy it already computes.
2. **Activation-based methods** — extract hidden state activations from a frozen forward pass (`output_hidden_states=True`), then train a small separate EBM classifier (a lightweight Gibbs model, typically [1024→256→64→1]) on those extracted features via Noise Contrastive Estimation.
3. **Structural verification** — execute the LLM's generated code against test cases. No model weights involved at all.

The "training" in Carnot refers to training the small EBM classifier on activation features extracted from a frozen LLM — not gradient descent on the LLM itself. This is fundamentally different from fine-tuning, RLHF, or DPO, which modify the language model's parameters. Carnot's approach is closer to probing or introspection: we observe what the model already knows internally and build a lightweight detector on top of it.

## The Path to Self-Learning

Carnot is designed from the ground up to support an automated self-improvement loop (LLM proposes, energy function evaluates):

1. **Propose** — candidate improvements to architecture, training, or hyperparameters are prototyped in Python/JAX
2. **Evaluate** — the energy landscape on held-out data serves as the objective judge (did energy decrease? real improvement. did it not? rejected.)
3. **Deploy** — proven improvements are transpiled to Rust for production performance
4. **Repeat** — the loop runs without human supervision, with safety guardrails

The EBM itself is the evaluator. No LLM needed to judge quality — the math provides ground truth.

## Key Results (85+ experiments, 16 models, 4 milestones)

### What actually works in practice

| Approach | Domain | Result | Practical? |
|----------|--------|--------|-----------|
| **Verify-repair loop (Ising)** | QA | 60% → 87% | **Yes** — constraint-guided repair |
| **HumanEval + Ising fuzzing** | Code | pass@1: 90% → 96% | **Yes** — instrumentation + repair |
| **Live LLM constraint pipeline** | All | 19/20, 100% detection | **Yes** — end-to-end verified |
| Logprob rejection sampling | QA | +10% accuracy | **Yes** — no training needed |
| Composite scoring (logprob + tests) | Code | 0% → 30% | **Yes** — structural verification |
| SAT gradient repair | Constraints | 60% → 80% | **Yes** — mathematical |

### What works on test sets but fails in practice

| Approach | Test Accuracy | Practical Result | Why It Fails |
|----------|-------------|-----------------|-------------|
| Per-token EBM (best) | 88.5% | 50% on real questions | Detects confidence, not correctness |
| Multi-layer concat | 81.3% | Not tested in deployment | Same fundamental limitation |
| Activation steering | 0% effect | N/A | Statistical ≠ causal |
| Cross-model transfer | ~50% (chance) | N/A | Model-specific representations |
| Cross-domain training | 70.8% (worse) | N/A | Domain-specific signals |

**The core problem:** activation-based EBMs measure how confident the model is, not whether it's right. A model that confidently says "Neil Armstrong walked on Mars" produces activations indistinguishable from "Neil Armstrong walked on the Moon." The EBM rewards confident hallucination and penalizes correct hedging — the exact opposite of what a hallucination detector should do.

See the [technical report](docs/technical-report.md) for the full 85+ experiment analysis.

## 14 Principles Learned

Hard-won lessons from 85+ experiments across 16 model families. These negative results are the project's primary contribution — they document what doesn't work and why, saving other researchers months of dead ends.

### What works
1. **The model's own logprobs are the best energy.** No external EBM needed for rejection sampling — the LLM's own confidence is already an energy function. Simple, practical, +10%.
2. **Different energy signals dominate in different domains.** Logprobs for QA, structural tests for code. The composite combines both and is never worse than either alone.
3. **Multi-layer concatenation improves test-set detection by ~6%.** Concatenating activations from layers 4+12+24 achieves 81.3% vs 75.5% for the final layer alone.

### What doesn't work (and why)
4. **Activation EBMs detect confidence, not correctness.** The fundamental limitation. Confident hallucinations produce activations indistinguishable from confident correct answers. Test-set accuracy (75-88%) does not translate to practical detection (50%).
5. **Instruction tuning compresses the hallucination signal.** Base models: 86.8%. Instruction-tuned: 75.0%. RLHF makes models sound confident even when wrong.
6. **Chain-of-thought compresses it further.** Disabling thinking improves detection from 61.3% → 75.5%. Thinking makes hidden states more uniform.
7. **Statistical difference ≠ causal influence.** A direction that separates correct from hallucinated activations does NOT steer the model when injected during generation.
8. **Adversarial questions defeat post-hoc detection.** On TruthfulQA, neither logprob nor EBM rejection improves over greedy.
9. **Hallucination representations are model-specific.** Cross-model transfer is at chance (~50%). Each model needs its own EBM.
10. **EBM detection is domain-specific.** Mixing datasets hurts (70.8% < 75.5%). Mixing temperatures hurts. Train on your target domain only.
11. **Normalization doesn't enable transfer.** Z-score, L2, and PCA whitening all destroy signal without improving cross-domain or cross-model transfer.
12. **Upstream question-level detection is weak.** The model's representation of the question partially predicts hallucination (62.6%) but not usefully.

### Scaling observations
13. **EBM accuracy scales with model size** within a family. Qwen3.5: 75.5% (0.8B) → 88.5% (27B). But this is test-set accuracy — the confidence-vs-correctness problem applies at all scales.
14. **MoE architectures vary wildly.** Qwen3.5-35B has 256 genuinely specialized experts (0.008 overlap). Mixtral has 8 near-identical experts (0.997 overlap). Fundamentally different knowledge organization.

## Tools

### CLI

```bash
pip install -e .
carnot verify examples/math_funcs.py --func gcd --test "(12,8):4" --test "(7,13):1"
```

### MCP Server

Configure with `cp .mcp.json.example .mcp.json` for Claude Code integration. Exposes `verify_code`, `verify_with_properties`, and `score_candidates` tools via stdio JSON-RPC. These tools perform **Python code verification** (structural tests, property-based testing, candidate ranking) — they do not implement the activation-based EBM hallucination detection described in the research sections.

See [docs/usage-guide.md](docs/usage-guide.md) for detailed setup and usage instructions.

## Model Tiers

| Tier | Name | Scale | Use Case |
|------|------|-------|----------|
| Large | **Boltzmann** | Deep residual + attention | Research frontiers, large-scale generation |
| Medium | **Gibbs** | Multi-layer MLP (2-4 hidden) | Applied ML, domain adaptation |
| Efficient | **KAN** | Learnable B-spline edges | Best accuracy/param ratio (0.994 AUROC, 2.3K params) |
| Small | **Ising** | Pairwise quadratic | Edge deployment, hardware (FPGA/TSU), teaching |

All tiers implement the same `EnergyFunction` trait (Rust) / protocol (Python), so algorithms written against the interface work with any tier.

## Development Philosophy

Carnot follows **spec-anchored development**:

1. **Spec first** — every feature starts as REQ-* and SCENARIO-* in OpenSpec
2. **Tests trace to specs** — every test references the requirement it verifies
3. **100% coverage** — code coverage and spec coverage enforced by pre-commit hooks
4. **Dual implementation** — Rust for performance, Python/JAX for research iteration
5. **Cross-language interop** — safetensors serialization + PyO3 bindings

See [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) for the full development workflow.

## Pre-trained Models

16 per-token EBM models are available on HuggingFace at [huggingface.co/Carnot-EBM](https://huggingface.co/Carnot-EBM).

**Important caveat:** These models achieve 75-88% accuracy on held-out TruthfulQA test sets, but this metric is misleading. In practical deployment (8 real questions), the EBM agreed with ground truth only 50% of the time. The EBMs detect model *confidence*, not *correctness* — they are research artifacts for studying activation-space structure, not production hallucination detectors. See the [practical test results](scripts/experiment_practical_mcp_test.py).
