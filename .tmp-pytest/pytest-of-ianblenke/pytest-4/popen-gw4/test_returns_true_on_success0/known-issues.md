## RETRO-MANIFEST-FULL-SCOPE: CRITICAL — Human Intervention Required (Milestone .70)

ExclusionManifestEnforcer pre_launch_check() is NOT wired to the conductor loop.
This is the 12th consecutive milestone where the manifest has not been enforced
mechanically. The rule in CLAUDE.md (planning-layer discipline) is the ONLY active
enforcement. A conductor-level hook is blocked by the 'do NOT modify
scripts/research_conductor.py' constraint. Action required: grant human permission
to modify scripts/research_conductor.py for this single wiring change.
