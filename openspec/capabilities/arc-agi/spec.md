# ARC-AGI Live Agent Capability Specification

**Capability:** arc-agi
**Version:** 0.1.0
**Status:** Draft

## Overview

Defines ARC-AGI-3 live-agent requirements that are not level-solve claims. The
agent must use its own visible runtime events. It must not read game source,
hidden state, offline ground-truth search, or hand adapters on the scored path.

## Requirements

### REQ-ARC-ARM-6387: Active Reward-Machine Discriminator

Experiment 6387 SHALL add a bounded, default-off reward-machine hypothesis
frontier over visible live events. Each hypothesis SHALL be a small automaton
with bounded states, visible event symbols, deterministic transitions, and
source-linked transition evidence. The mechanism SHALL use legal actions from
the live frame action set. It SHALL not mutate the action set.

The frontier SHALL choose a probe only when at least two active hypotheses make
different outcome predictions for one legal action. It SHALL score legal actions
by expected hypothesis elimination. If no legal disagreement action exists, if
evidence is late, if all predictions are unknown, or if the bounded capacity is
exhausted without a safe split, the policy SHALL abstain and defer to the
unchanged base policy.

The policy SHALL freeze the chosen action, legal action set, active hypothesis
IDs, and predictions before the environment transition is read. The resulting
transition SHALL be used only as evaluation evidence for the next step. The
frontier SHALL reject duplicate evidence, refuse contradictory all-mismatch
evidence without eliminating all hypotheses, evict deterministically at capacity,
and time out stale pending probes.

Observed transitions SHALL feed the Exp6386 two-sided goal-evidence contract.
Reward-machine evidence can guide future probes, but it SHALL NOT terminate
search, update `ops/arc_solve_registry.yaml`, or claim a game or level solve.
The feature SHALL be reachable from
`make_carnot_agent -> E3AgentPolicy`, SHALL default off in
`SUBMITTED_AGENT_CONFIG`, and the shipped default SHALL not change actions.

Experiment 6387 SHALL write
`results/experiment_6387_arc_active_reward_machine_discriminator.json` with the
required top-level fields named by the task. The artifact SHALL set
`arc_solve_claim=false`, SHALL omit `solve_provenance`, SHALL set
`verifier_is_oracle=false`, and SHALL set
`arc_active_reward_machine_ready_score=1.0` only when treatment reachability and
evidence integrity pass with zero forbidden access and zero registry writes.

### SCENARIO-ARC-ARM-6387-LEGAL-DISAGREEMENT

**Given** two to five game-blind reward-machine hypotheses over visible events
and a runtime legal action set
**When** one legal action has unique disagreement and a non-legal action would
also split hypotheses
**Then** the frontier selects only the legal disagreement action, freezes the
action and active predictions before the outcome, and records expected
hypothesis elimination without reading source, adapters, offline BFS, or hidden
state.

### SCENARIO-ARC-ARM-6387-ABSTAIN-AND-BOUNDS

**Given** no-disagreement actions, delayed evidence, repeated frames,
contradictory evidence, duplicate evidence, capacity overflow, and stale pending
probe deadlines
**When** the frontier ranks probes and ingests outcomes
**Then** it abstains when no safe split exists, deduplicates repeated evidence,
records contradictions without wrong elimination, evicts deterministically, times
out stale probes, and defers to the base policy.

### SCENARIO-ARC-ARM-6387-TWO-SIDED-EVIDENCE

**Given** a frozen reward-machine probe and the next visible environment
transition
**When** the transition is ingested after the action freeze
**Then** each active hypothesis receives a source-linked two-sided event, firing
witnesses and non-firing contrasts are evaluated by the Exp6386 contract, and
unverified or rejected hypotheses do not terminate search or earn solve credit.

### SCENARIO-ARC-ARM-6387-LIVE-DEFAULT-OFF

**Given** the normal live entrypoint
`make_carnot_agent -> E3AgentPolicy`
**When** the submitted default constructs the policy
**Then** the reward-machine feature is off, base-policy fallback is unchanged,
and enabling `CARNOT_ARC_ACTIVE_REWARD_MACHINE=1` proves reachability without a
registry write or a solve claim.

### SCENARIO-ARC-ARM-6387-ARTIFACT-NO-SOLVE

**Given** Exp6386 passed and the registry hash is captured before the run
**When** Exp6387 writes its artifact
**Then** all required fields are present, protected files are unchanged,
forbidden access counts are zero, `arc_solve_claim` is false,
`verifier_is_oracle` is false, `solve_provenance` is absent, and the registry
hash is unchanged.
