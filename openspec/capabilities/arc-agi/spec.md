# ARC-AGI Live Agent Capability Specification

**Capability:** arc-agi
**Version:** 0.1.0
**Status:** Draft

## Overview

Defines ARC-AGI-3 live-agent requirements that are not level-solve claims. The
agent must use its own visible runtime events. It must not read game source,
hidden state, offline ground-truth search, or hand adapters on the scored path.

## Requirements

### REQ-ARC-ARM-6387: Active Reward-Machine Discriminator

Experiment 6387 SHALL add a bounded, default-off reward-machine hypothesis
frontier over visible live events. Each hypothesis SHALL be a small automaton
with bounded states, visible event symbols, deterministic transitions, and
source-linked transition evidence. The mechanism SHALL use legal actions from
the live frame action set. It SHALL not mutate the action set.

The frontier SHALL choose a probe only when at least two active hypotheses make
different outcome predictions for one legal action. It SHALL score legal actions
by expected hypothesis elimination. If no legal disagreement action exists, if
evidence is late, if all predictions are unknown, or if the bounded capacity is
exhausted without a safe split, the policy SHALL abstain and defer to the
unchanged base policy.

The policy SHALL freeze the chosen action, legal action set, active hypothesis
IDs, and predictions before the environment transition is read. The resulting
transition SHALL be used only as evaluation evidence for the next step. The
frontier SHALL reject duplicate evidence, refuse contradictory all-mismatch
evidence without eliminating all hypotheses, evict deterministically at capacity,
and time out stale pending probes.

Observed transitions SHALL feed the Exp6386 two-sided goal-evidence contract.
Reward-machine evidence can guide future probes, but it SHALL NOT terminate
search, update `ops/arc_solve_registry.yaml`, or claim a game or level solve.
The feature SHALL be reachable from
`make_carnot_agent -> E3AgentPolicy`, SHALL default off in
`SUBMITTED_AGENT_CONFIG`, and the shipped default SHALL not change actions.

Experiment 6387 SHALL write
`results/experiment_6387_arc_active_reward_machine_discriminator.json` with the
required top-level fields named by the task. The artifact SHALL set
`arc_solve_claim=false`, SHALL omit `solve_provenance`, SHALL set
`verifier_is_oracle=false`, and SHALL set
`arc_active_reward_machine_ready_score=1.0` only when treatment reachability and
evidence integrity pass with zero forbidden access and zero registry writes.

### SCENARIO-ARC-ARM-6387-LEGAL-DISAGREEMENT

**Given** two to five game-blind reward-machine hypotheses over visible events
and a runtime legal action set
**When** one legal action has unique disagreement and a non-legal action would
also split hypotheses
**Then** the frontier selects only the legal disagreement action, freezes the
action and active predictions before the outcome, and records expected
hypothesis elimination without reading source, adapters, offline BFS, or hidden
state.

### SCENARIO-ARC-ARM-6387-ABSTAIN-AND-BOUNDS

**Given** no-disagreement actions, delayed evidence, repeated frames,
contradictory evidence, duplicate evidence, capacity overflow, and stale pending
probe deadlines
**When** the frontier ranks probes and ingests outcomes
**Then** it abstains when no safe split exists, deduplicates repeated evidence,
records contradictions without wrong elimination, evicts deterministically, times
out stale probes, and defers to the base policy.

### SCENARIO-ARC-ARM-6387-TWO-SIDED-EVIDENCE

**Given** a frozen reward-machine probe and the next visible environment
transition
**When** the transition is ingested after the action freeze
**Then** each active hypothesis receives a source-linked two-sided event, firing
witnesses and non-firing contrasts are evaluated by the Exp6386 contract, and
unverified or rejected hypotheses do not terminate search or earn solve credit.

### SCENARIO-ARC-ARM-6387-LIVE-DEFAULT-OFF

**Given** the normal live entrypoint
`make_carnot_agent -> E3AgentPolicy`
**When** the submitted default constructs the policy
**Then** the reward-machine feature is off, base-policy fallback is unchanged,
and enabling `CARNOT_ARC_ACTIVE_REWARD_MACHINE=1` proves reachability without a
registry write or a solve claim.

### SCENARIO-ARC-ARM-6387-ARTIFACT-NO-SOLVE

**Given** Exp6386 passed and the registry hash is captured before the run
**When** Exp6387 writes its artifact
**Then** all required fields are present, protected files are unchanged,
forbidden access counts are zero, `arc_solve_claim` is false,
`verifier_is_oracle` is false, `solve_provenance` is absent, and the registry
hash is unchanged.

### REQ-ARC-ARM-6388: Goal-Evidence Response Calibration

Experiment 6388 SHALL calibrate goal-evidence response on matched visible ARC
trajectory prefixes after the Exp6387 gate passes. The harness SHALL compare
the current gate, a frozen-prior control, passive two-sided evidence, and active
reward-machine evidence. Each arm SHALL receive matched model calls, token
capacity, trajectory exposure, deadlines, and evaluation opportunities.

The model set SHALL include `unsloth/Qwen3.6-35B-A3B-GGUF`,
`unsloth/gemma-4-31B-it-GGUF`, and
`unsloth/gemma-4-26B-A4B-it-GGUF`, resolved through the cached SOTA GGUF path.
The harness SHALL use the GGUF-embedded tokenizer path. It SHALL report zero
AutoTokenizer usage.

For each model and prefix, the harness SHALL freeze the goal hypothesis,
confidence or abstention, evidence references, and next legal probe before it
reads later transitions. Later transitions SHALL label calibration only. No arm
SHALL terminate a level, update solve credit, write the solve registry, read
hidden source, use offline search, use a GameAdapter, use an external scorer, or
read hidden state.

Experiment 6388 SHALL write
`results/experiment_6388_arc_goal_evidence_response_calibration.json` with the
required top-level fields named by the task. The artifact SHALL set
`arc_solve_claim=false`, SHALL omit `solve_provenance`, SHALL set
`verifier_is_oracle=false`, and SHALL set
`arc_evidence_calibration_ready_score=1.0` only when all models and arms have
complete receipts, all controls pass, the active treatment fires, forbidden
access counts are zero, and the registry hash is unchanged.

### SCENARIO-ARC-ARM-6388-MATCHED-PREFIXES

**Given** sealed visible frames, actions, legal sets, evidence identities,
prefix boundaries, and evaluation labels
**When** Exp6388 preregisters the current-gate, frozen-prior, passive
two-sided, and active reward-machine arms
**Then** every arm receives matched token capacity, trajectory exposure,
deadlines, and evaluation opportunities without duplicate solve targets.

### SCENARIO-ARC-ARM-6388-FROZEN-PREDICTIONS

**Given** a model, arm, and live trajectory prefix
**When** the harness records a goal hypothesis, confidence or abstention,
evidence references, and next legal probe
**Then** the prediction receipt is sealed before the later transition label is
read, and the later transition is used only for calibration.

### SCENARIO-ARC-ARM-6388-METRICS-AND-CONTROLS

**Given** accepted, rejected, unverifiable, false accept, false reject, true
accept, and true reject outcomes
**When** Exp6388 compares active evidence with the current gate
**Then** it reports precision, coverage, calibration error, monotonicity,
hypothesis elimination, response to added evidence, unrounded deltas, and the
shuffled-evidence, duplicate-evidence, surface-relabeled, no-win-window,
model-identity-blind, action-order, deadline, and result-before-prediction
controls.

### SCENARIO-ARC-ARM-6388-ARTIFACT-NO-SOLVE

**Given** the Exp6387 gate passes and the registry hash is captured before the
run
**When** Exp6388 writes its artifact
**Then** all required fields are present, `solve_provenance` is absent,
protected files are unchanged, forbidden access counts are zero,
`arc_solve_claim` is false, `verifier_is_oracle` is false, and the registry hash
is unchanged.

### REQ-ARC-ARM-6393: Scalar ARC Gate-Metric Contract

Experiment 6393 SHALL replay immutable Exp6388 row-level evidence into bare
numeric gate fields. It SHALL recompute pooled admission precision, admission
precision delta, false-accept count, and false-accept delta from frozen rows.
It SHALL NOT trust the nested Exp6388 aggregate as the source of truth.

The producer SHALL emit `delta_admission_precision_scalar` and
`delta_false_accept_count_scalar` as finite bare numbers. It SHALL keep
by-model values in separate detail fields. Mapping, list, string, bool, NaN,
infinity, rounded sign-change, missing-row, duplicate-row, stale-hash, and
model-order attacks SHALL fail closed.

Experiment 6393 SHALL write
`results/experiment_6393_arc_scalar_gate_metric_contract.json` with the required
top-level fields named by the task. The artifact SHALL set
`arc_gate_metric_contract_ready_score=1.0` only when the row replay reproduces
the V549 Exp6388 metrics, every scalar gate field is finite, all coercion
attacks fail closed, Exp6388 and Exp6389 remain unchanged, and no live route or
solve claim is made.

### SCENARIO-ARC-ARM-6393-ROW-REPLAY

**Given** immutable Exp6388 frozen prediction rows
**When** Exp6393 recomputes the active and current gate counts
**Then** active pooled admission precision is 1.0, delta admission precision is
0.75, active false accepts are 0, delta false accepts are -9, and by-model
detail rows are preserved outside the conductor scalar fields.

### SCENARIO-ARC-ARM-6393-ATTACKS-FAIL-CLOSED

**Given** malformed scalar values, non-finite floats, rounded sign changes,
missing model rows, duplicate rows, stale hashes, and model-order swaps
**When** Exp6393 validates the producer contract
**Then** each case is rejected before a ready score can be set.

### SCENARIO-ARC-ARM-6393-GATE-REPLAY

**Given** the planned Exp6400 gate predicates over Exp6393
**When** the conductor comparison function evaluates the new artifact fields
**Then** each comparison receives a finite bare number and the exact operands,
operator, result, and reason are recorded.
