# Verifiable Reasoning Capability Specification

**Capability:** verifiable-reasoning
**Version:** 0.1.0
**Status:** Draft
**Traces to:** FR-12

## Overview

Defines how Carnot provides deterministic, verifiable reasoning through energy-based constraint satisfaction. Where LLMs produce outputs that are plausible but unverifiable, Carnot evaluates configurations against an energy function that encodes hard constraints — producing outputs that are provably correct or precisely diagnosable when wrong.

This capability is the foundation for the anti-hallucination guarantee: a configuration at an energy minimum satisfies all encoded constraints by mathematical necessity, not by statistical likelihood.

## Requirements

### REQ-VERIFY-001: Constraint Encoding

The system shall support encoding logical, physical, and domain constraints as terms in an energy function, where:
- Each constraint contributes a non-negative energy term
- A satisfied constraint contributes zero (or near-zero) energy
- A violated constraint contributes energy proportional to the severity of the violation
- The total energy is the sum of all constraint terms

### REQ-VERIFY-002: Constraint Decomposition

The system shall provide per-constraint energy decomposition: given a configuration, report the individual energy contribution of each constraint term, enabling identification of which specific constraints are satisfied and which are violated.

### REQ-VERIFY-003: Verification Certificate

The system shall produce a verification result for a given configuration containing:
- Total energy (scalar)
- Per-constraint energy breakdown (named map)
- Boolean satisfaction flag per constraint (energy below threshold)
- Overall verdict: VERIFIED (all constraints satisfied) or VIOLATED (with list of failing constraints)

### REQ-VERIFY-004: Constraint Composition

The system shall support composing constraint sets from independent sources:
- Multiple constraint functions can be combined into a single energy function
- Constraints can be weighted to express relative importance
- New constraints can be added without modifying existing ones

### REQ-VERIFY-005: Gradient-Based Repair

When a configuration violates one or more constraints, the system shall support targeted repair via gradient descent on the violated constraint terms only, without perturbing the parts of the configuration that already satisfy their constraints.

### REQ-VERIFY-006: Energy Landscape Certification

The system shall provide tools to analyze the energy landscape around a solution:
- Local minimum verification (Hessian eigenvalue analysis)
- Basin of attraction estimation (perturbation sensitivity)
- Saddle point detection

### REQ-VERIFY-007: Deterministic Reproducibility

Given identical inputs, model parameters, and random seeds, the system shall produce bit-identical energy values and verification results across runs (within the same language implementation).

### REQ-JEPA-002: Tier 3 Fast-Path Gate

The `VerifyRepairPipeline.verify()` method shall support an optional JEPA predictor gate that:
- Accepts `jepa_predictor` (optional `JEPAViolationPredictor`) and `jepa_threshold` (float, default 0.5)
- When a predictor is provided, embeds the first 50 whitespace-split tokens of the response and queries the predictor for per-domain violation probabilities
- If `max(probabilities) < jepa_threshold`, returns a `VerificationResult` with `mode="FAST_PATH"`, `skipped=True`, and `verified=True` (optimistic low-risk assumption)
- When no predictor is provided, behaves identically to the original full-pipeline path (backward compatible)
- `VerificationResult` shall include `mode: str = "FULL"` and `skipped: bool = False` fields (defaulting to full-path semantics for all existing callers)

## Scenarios

### SCENARIO-VERIFY-001: Sudoku Constraint Satisfaction

**Given** a 9x9 Sudoku puzzle encoded as an energy function where:
- Row uniqueness constraint: E_row = sum of penalties for duplicate values in each row
- Column uniqueness constraint: E_col = same for columns
- Box uniqueness constraint: E_box = same for 3x3 boxes
- Given clue constraint: E_clue = penalty for deviating from provided clues
**When** the system verifies a candidate solution
**Then** it reports per-constraint energy (E_row, E_col, E_box, E_clue)
**And** a correct solution has total energy = 0 and verdict = VERIFIED
**And** an incorrect solution has energy > 0 with specific failing constraints identified

### SCENARIO-VERIFY-002: Gradient-Based Repair

**Given** a Sudoku configuration with 3 constraint violations
**When** gradient-based repair is applied for N steps
**Then** the number of violations decreases monotonically (on average)
**And** previously satisfied constraints remain satisfied (energy does not increase for non-violated terms)

### SCENARIO-VERIFY-003: Constraint Decomposition

**Given** an energy function composed of 4 independent constraint terms
**When** per-constraint decomposition is requested for a configuration
**Then** the sum of individual constraint energies equals the total energy (within floating-point tolerance)
**And** each constraint is identified by name

### SCENARIO-VERIFY-004: Constraint Composition

**Given** two independently defined constraint sets A and B
**When** they are composed into a single energy function with weights [1.0, 2.0]
**Then** the composed energy equals E_A(x) + 2.0 * E_B(x)
**And** verification reports decomposed energies for both A and B sub-constraints

### SCENARIO-VERIFY-005: Local Minimum Verification

**Given** a configuration that the sampler reports as converged
**When** local minimum verification is requested
**Then** the system reports whether all Hessian eigenvalues are positive (true local minimum)
**And** estimates the basin of attraction radius via perturbation analysis

### SCENARIO-VERIFY-006: Deterministic Reproducibility

**Given** a model and input configuration
**When** energy is computed twice with the same random seed
**Then** the results are bit-identical

### SCENARIO-VERIFY-007: Comparison with LLM Output

**Given** a constraint satisfaction problem (e.g., scheduling, planning)
**When** an LLM-generated solution and a Carnot-minimized solution are both verified
**Then** the Carnot solution has energy = 0 (all constraints satisfied)
**And** the LLM solution has energy > 0 in at least some constraint terms (hallucinated violations)
**And** the specific violations in the LLM output are identified by constraint name
